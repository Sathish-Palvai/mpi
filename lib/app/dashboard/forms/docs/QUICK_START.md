## ✅ Setup Complete!

The config-driven participant form is now integrated and ready to use!

---

## 🎯 How to Test (3 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Hot Restart Your App
```bash
# In VS Code: Press Ctrl+Shift+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+F5 on Mac)
# Or in terminal:
flutter run
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to Dashboard
- Open your app
- Go to the Dashboard screen
- Find the Participants tab

### 3️⃣ Open Config-Driven Form
**Option A: Long Press (Recommended)**
- Long press on any participant card (hold for ~1 second)

**Option B: Double Tap (Traditional)**
- Double tap opens the traditional form (unchanged)
- This preserves existing workflow

## 🎬 Usage Demo

```dart
// Traditional way (still works)
context.go('/participant-detail', extra: participantData);

// New config-driven way
context.go('/participant-config', extra: participantData);
```

## 🔍 Side-by-Side Comparison

Open the same participant in both forms to see the difference:

| Aspect | Traditional | Config-Driven |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Code Lines | ~1,600 | ~790 |
| Controller Setup | Manual | Auto |
| Validation | Repeated | Declarative |
| Field Definition | Scattered | Centralized |
| Adding Field | 5+ locations | 1 config object |
| Maintenance | Find & replace | Update schema |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Form doesn't appear"
→ Did you hot restart (not just hot reload)?

### "Long press doesn't work"
→ Hold for about 1 second on the participant card

### "Navigation error"
→ Check console logs for details

### "Fields not populating"
→ Verify participant data structure matches field IDs

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Today:
1. **Test the form** with real participant data
2. **Compare behavior** with traditional form
3. **Check validation** rules work correctly

### This Week:
1. **Gather feedback** from team
2. **Note any issues** or improvements
3. **Consider extending** to other forms

### Long Term:
1. **Decide on migration** strategy
2. **Create form library** of reusable configs
3. **Write tests** for form schemas

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Fast Testing
Use long press for quick A/B comparison between forms

### Tip 2: Form Extension
Need a new field? Just add to `ParticipantFormSchema`:
```dart
FormFieldConfig(
  id: 'NewField',
  label: 'New Field',
  type: FieldType.text,
  required: true,
)
```

### Tip 3: Debugging
Check browser console for form submission payloads

### Tip 4: Responsive Testing
Resize browser window to test mobile/desktop layouts
