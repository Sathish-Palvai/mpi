# Testing Guide: Config-Driven Participant Form

## 🎉 Setup Complete!

The config-driven form has been successfully integrated into your application!

## 🚀 How to Test

### Option 1: Long Press Menu (Recommended)
1. **Run your app** (hot restart if already running)
2. **Navigate to Dashboard** 
3. **Find any participant** in the list
4. **Long press** on the participant card
5. A dialog will appear with two options:
   - **Traditional Form** - Opens the existing participant detail screen
   - **Config-Driven Form** - Opens the new config-driven implementation
6. Select **"Config-Driven Form"** to test the new implementation

### Option 2: Direct Navigation (For Development)
You can also navigate directly in code:
```dart
context.go('/participant-config', extra: participantData);
```

## 📋 What to Test

### 1. **Form Display**
- [ ] All fields render correctly
- [ ] Labels are visible and properly formatted
- [ ] Required fields show asterisk (*)
- [ ] Placeholder text is visible

### 2. **Responsive Layout**
- [ ] Desktop (>600px): Fields arranged horizontally with proper flex ratios
- [ ] Mobile (<600px): Fields stack vertically
- [ ] Resize window to test transitions

### 3. **Validation**
- [ ] Try saving with empty required fields
- [ ] Enter less than minimum characters (ParticipantName needs 4+ chars)
- [ ] Enter more than maximum characters
- [ ] Check phone number pattern validation
- [ ] Verify error messages appear below fields

### 4. **Field Types**
- [ ] Text fields accept input
- [ ] Date fields show date picker
- [ ] Select/dropdown fields show options
- [ ] Readonly fields are disabled
- [ ] Phone fields format correctly

### 5. **Data Loading**
- [ ] Existing participant data loads into fields
- [ ] TransactionId field is hidden (visible: false)
- [ ] CompanyShortName is readonly

### 6. **Form Submission**
- [ ] Fill all required fields
- [ ] Click "Save Participant" button
- [ ] Check console for payload
- [ ] Verify success/error messages

## 🔍 Compare with Traditional Form

Open the same participant in both forms to compare:

| Feature | Traditional Form | Config-Driven Form |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Lines of Code | ~1600+ | ~790 |
| Field Definition | Scattered throughout file | Centralized in schema |
| Controller Setup | Manual in initState | Auto-generated |
| Validation | Repeated code | Declarative config |
| Maintenance | Find & replace | Update config |

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Form Schema
The form has 3 main sections:

**Section 1: Basic Information**
- ParticipantName (required, 4-50 chars)
- ParticipantType (select dropdown)

**Section 2: Area and Dates**
- Area (text field)
- StartDate (date picker)
- EndDate (date picker)

**Section 3: Company Information**
- CompanyShortName (readonly)
- CompanyLongName (text field)

**Other Controls Section:**
- PhonePart1, PhonePart2, PhonePart3 (phone fields, no labels)
- TransactionId (hidden field)

### Validation Rules
- **ParticipantName**: Required, 4-50 characters
- **ParticipantType**: Required
- **StartDate**: Required
- **CompanyShortName**: Required (but readonly)
- **CompanyLongName**: Required, max 100 characters

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Form doesn't appear
- Make sure you hot restarted (not just hot reload)
- Check that routes were added to main.dart
- Verify import path is correct

### Long press doesn't work
- Hold the press for about 1 second
- Make sure you're pressing on the participant card itself

### Navigation error
- Check console for error messages
- Verify participant data structure matches expected format

### Fields not populating
- Check participant data in debugger
- Verify field IDs match keys in participant map
- Look for case sensitivity issues

## 📊 Performance Comparison

After testing both forms, you should notice:

1. **Faster Development**: Adding/modifying fields is much quicker
2. **Consistent Behavior**: All fields follow same patterns
3. **Less Code**: ~50% reduction in boilerplate
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes in one central location

## ✅ Success Criteria

The integration is successful if:
- [x] Route added to main.dart
- [x] Import path correct
- [ ] App runs without errors
- [ ] Long press menu appears on participant cards
- [ ] Config-driven form opens when selected
- [ ] Form validates correctly
- [ ] Form saves data successfully
- [ ] Responsive layout works on different screen sizes

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with different participants
2. **Compare side-by-side** with traditional form
3. **Gather feedback** from team members
4. **Extend if needed** (see CONFIG_DRIVEN_FORMS_README.md)
5. **Consider migration** of other forms to config-driven approach
